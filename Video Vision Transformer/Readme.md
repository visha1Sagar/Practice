# Video Vision Transformer
## Project Overview
This project implements a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT), a transformer-based architecture for video classification. The model is built on the principles outlined in the ViViT paper by Arnab et al. The ViViT model processes video data by leveraging the power of transformers to model both spatial and temporal features, using techniques like tubelet embedding to effectively capture video frames and build a classification pipeline.
